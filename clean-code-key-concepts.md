## Key Concepts  

### 1. Writing Clean Code
- Code should be **easy to read and understand**.
- Good code is like **well-written prose**—it should communicate intent clearly.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.

### 2. Meaningful Names
- Use **descriptive, intention-revealing names**.
- Avoid generic terms like `data` or `info`—be specific.
- Use consistent **naming conventions**.

### 3. Functions Should Be Simple and Small
- A function should **do one thing and do it well** (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Keep functions short—preferably **5-10 lines**.
- Function names should clearly describe their purpose.

### 4. Comments Should Be Minimal and Meaningful
- **Good code is self-explanatory** and doesn’t need excessive comments.
- Comments should explain **why**, not **what**.
- Avoid redundant or misleading comments.

### 5. Formatting and Readability
- Use **consistent indentation and spacing**.
- Break long expressions into **smaller, digestible** parts.
- Keep related code **together**.

### 6. Error Handling and Exceptions
- Use **exceptions instead of error codes**.
- Don’t return `null`—it often leads to `NullPointerException` issues.
- **Fail fast** by validating inputs early.

### 7. Unit Testing and TDD
- Write **tests for every piece of functionality**.
- Follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:  
  - **Write a failing test** → **Write just enough code to pass the test** → **Refactor**.
- Tests should be **clean and maintainable**, just like production code.

### 8. Object-Oriented Design (SOLID Principles)
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have **only one reason to change**.  
- **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP): Code should be **open for extension, but closed for modification**.  
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be replaceable with their base types without issues.  
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP): Avoid large, bloated interfaces.  
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on **abstractions, not concrete implementations**.

### 9. Refactoring and Continuous Improvement
- Regularly refactor code to **keep it clean and efficient**.
- **Small, incremental improvements** prevent technical debt.
- Follow the **Boy Scout Rule**: "Always leave the code cleaner than you found it."
