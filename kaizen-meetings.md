On **2020-11-16** by [Alejandro](https://github.com/AlejandroRG31)

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

Flutter is based in the idea that every frontend component is a Widget, this means that every screen, container, button... is treated as an object which has attributes, contain other widgets and can do/call actions

Flutter was made by google, and uses Dart as language and the main database used is Firebase both also made by google.
